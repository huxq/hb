This piece of software aims to build an opensource planform for home automation.
It starts with a sunshade filpper
The whole harware design is extensively tested and improved by myself(9+ month) with over 5 iterations of redesign.
Hope you can enjoy this piece of work
At the moment I have the hand soldered board for debugging and testing. I will make a PCB and release the PCB design as well
